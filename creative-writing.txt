HOW TO INTEGRATE THEME INTO YOUR STORY
  Why does the story matter to you?
  What is the truth you want to convey
      give the protagonist the opposite of this truth (a lie)
      what makes the character fall into this opposite belief
      how did they act in the past to cement this belief firmly in thier subconcious
      craft an Aha moment that will liberate the character from the lie
      
Story is not about what happens, its about how what happens affects your characters
